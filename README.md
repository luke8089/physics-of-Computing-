Physics of Computing



Overview

This repository explores the intersection between physics and computation, emphasizing how physical principles govern computational systems. The project demonstrates how computation is not merely abstract logic but a physical process bounded by energy, matter, and time.

Project Description

The included Arduino sketch (bodacious_lahdi_bigery1.ino) serves as an experimental model illustrating fundamental physical aspects of computation. Through simple hardware interaction and measurable data, it highlights:

The relationship between information processing and energy consumption

The concept of computational limits as constrained by physical laws

How physical measurements can reflect computational states


This approach provides a hands-on demonstration of the Physics of Computing — linking thermodynamics, information theory, and computation.

Objectives

Demonstrate the physical nature of computation through experimental setups.

Examine the role of energy transfer and entropy in digital processing.

Explore hardware-level computation to illustrate theoretical concepts in real systems.


Methodology

Using Arduino-based microcontrollers, the project implements measurable computing operations. By correlating computational load and electrical behavior, we can infer how physical limits influence digital computation.

Core Concepts Demonstrated:

Energy–Information Relationship (Landauer’s Principle)

Entropy in Computation

Limits of Physical Computing Devices

Results and Analysis

Preliminary results show measurable energy variations across computational states, reinforcing the idea that computation incurs a physical cost. Further experimentation can deepen understanding of the trade-offs between processing power, energy efficiency, and physical constraints.
